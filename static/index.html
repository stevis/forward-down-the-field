              Any sports fan will tell you that the Detroit Lions are one of the most beleaguered franchises in the history of not only the NFL but of North American Sports in general. They hold nearly every embarrassing record in the NFL book, and have never won more
              than one playoff game let alone making a run at the Super Bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Forward Down the Field is the quest of a few life-long Lions fans to discover how their team became the butt of an NFL joke and what it will take to bring a Super Bowl to Detroit. Along the way they will talk to former players, die hard fans, and people
              in the Detroit sports community to get their take on what the team has meant to them over the years, how it has affected their lives, and how the team is deeply sewn into the fabric of Michigan. They will examine the parallels between the
              city of Detroit and the team that represents it on the gridiron. Both have fallen on hard times and are in desperate need of a comeback.

              For a never give up, blue collar town that is ready for a win on the field and off, a victory could make all of the difference. For once that victory could be right around the corner. It is a journey of passion, betrayal, hope and pride where the audience
              will discover what it really means to be a Lions Fan.
